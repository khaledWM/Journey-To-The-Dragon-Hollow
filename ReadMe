Purpose: C++ program that simulates a confined area which is a dragon Hollow.
         The grid is a flat area that is surrounded by trees on three sides and
          a cave on one side.The purpose of the program is to allow to hero
         characters to travel across the dragon hollow and claim the emerald and
         while doing so they encounter 3 types of enemies that will try to stop them
         from doing so by eliminating them.The heros are: Timmy tortoise and Harold the Hare,
         the enemies are dorcs, borcs and porcs.The cave is guarded by a dragon that instantly
         eliminates the heros if they come in contact.Only one hero is announced the winner
         when they make it through to the other side of the hollow all without dying and claiming
         the emerald.


Innovation: In any game, power ups are commonly used, it allows players to have a little bit of
            an advantage over other players,also no game is good enough unless the players are always in danger.
            I decided to implement 3 new characters as power ups, and one character that is always moving on
            the map and if this character comes in contact with the heros they instantly die.
            PowerUps:
            The power ups are scattered across the map, and they move vertically until they get to the border and then
            reverse similar to the dragons movement but on a wider scale.When timmy or harold get the boost a message
            will be displayed that one of the heros have received a boost.
            1.Medic: Allows timmy or harold to receive an extra health boost of 10 when they come in contact Char: 'M'
            2.Armour: Allows timmy or harold to receive an extra armour boost of 10 when they come in contact Char: 'A'
            3.ExtraStrength Allows timmy or harold to receive an extra strength of 10 boost when they come in contact Char: 'E'
            The chaser:
                      Chaser: Fast moving character that is on the enemy side, when he comes in contact with the
                      heros they instantly die, the chaser does not move like all the characters but he moves
                      twice as fast horizontally so that he can catch the heros faster. Char: 'C'
